# Intelligent Agent and Decision Making

This project aims to implement sequential decision making algorithms w/o and w/ distributed computation. The basic outline of this project is listed as follows:

### Basic Markov Decision Process

- Value Iteration (VI) for infinite horizon problems w/o distributed computing
- Value Iteration (VI) for infinite horizon problems w/ distributed computing
- Policy Iteration (PI) for infinite horizon problems

### Reinforcement Learning w/ Q Table

- SARSA algorithm
- Q-Learning algorithm w/o distributed computing
- Q-Learning algorithm w/ distributed computing

### Reinforcement Learning w/ Function Approximation

- Deep Q-Network w/o distributed computing 
- Deep Q-Network w/ distributed computing

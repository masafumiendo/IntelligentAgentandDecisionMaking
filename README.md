# Intelligent Agent and Decision Making

This project aims to implement sequential decision making algorithms w/o and w/ distributed computation. The basic outline of this project is listed as follows:

### Basic Markov Decision Process

- Value Iteration (VI) for infinite horizon problems w/o distributed computing
- Value Iteration (VI) for infinite horizon problems w/ distributed computing

### Reinforcement Learning


### Monte-Carlo Planning


Current progress is to implement VI w/o and w/ distributed computation. Other algorithms will be implemented in future.
